### Built With

[Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/)

## Getting Started

- Download `noise_logger_base.stl` and `noise_logger_lid.stl` from this repository

### Prerequisites

- 3D printer
- PETG or more durable filament (PLA does not perform well in outdoor environments)
- 4x M2.3x5mm self tapping screws
- 2x M4x20mm self tapping screws

## Usage

For high quality, print at a layer height of .12.

### Mount the electronics to the enclosure base

- Place the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W on the 4 posts.
- Place 2 of the M2 screws in opposite corner posts and screw the Pi Zero to the enclosure.
- Place the I2C Decibel Sound Level Meter Module on the 3 posts making sure the microphone aligns with the center post.
- Place 2 of the M2 screws on either side of the I2C dB module where the incuts are and screw the module to the enclosure

### Mount the lid

[TODO: more details]

- Using the 2x M4 screws, mount the lid to an ideal outdoor location

**Mount base to lid**

- Snap the enclosure base into the enclosure lid.
